Urda's Bash Files
=================

This is a collection of my bash prompt settings, aliases, exports, and more.

Bootstrapping urda.bash
-----------------------

If you are configuring a new shell, or you do not care if your `.bash*` files are overwritten,
you can use the following command to download the files from the project:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/urda/urda.bash/master/bootstrap-urda.bash.sh)
```
