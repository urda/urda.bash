# Urda's Bash Files

This is a collection of my bash prompt settings, aliases, exports, and other related shell scripts.

## Comparing to your local bash

After you clone this repo, you can also run a quick `diff` that will compare your local `bash` files against the repo files:

```bash
make diffs
```

## Running tests

This will also run a `make version-check`.

```bash
make test
```
